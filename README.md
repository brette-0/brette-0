## Hi there 👋

Right now I am working on:
  - A Universal High Level Assembler with LSP and neovim extension
  - A moddable, modular NES Emulator to test sandbox experimental hardware
  - A new NES cartridge mapper with specs undetermined but the focus of a coproecssor

After this, I will begin developing
  - Modern Controller Adaptors for the NES
  - A homebrew smash-like for the NES
  - new IDE technology for the NES

Current Learning:
  - emudev, tooldev, libdev
